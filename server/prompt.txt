1. **Introduction:**
   - Generate JSON data to represent a Tagine recipe for a web app that provides clear and structured information to users.
   - The goal is to create a user-friendly format with details on recipe steps, ingredients, equipment, and timings.

2. **Recipe Information:**
   - Include fields for the recipe name (`"recipe"`) and the number of people served (`"people_served"`).

3. **Ingredients:**
   - Utilize an array (`"ingredients"`) to list ingredients. Each ingredient should be represented as an object with the following fields 
      - (`"ingredient"`) - the name of the ingredient.
      - (`"quantity"`) - a DECIMAL string that represents the amount of the ingredient.
      - (`"unit"`) - an optional text representing the unit that the ingredient is mesured in.
      - (`"notes"`) - an optional notes field for additional details.

4. **Equipment:**
   - Use an array (`"equipment"`) to list the required tools or equipment.

5. **Steps:**
   - Employ an array (`"steps"`) to list sequential actions in the recipe.
   - For each step, include:
     - `"action"`: Specific action or task (presented as a sentence).
     - `"description"`: Further details about the action, providing additional context or instructions.
     - `"inputs"`: Array listing ingredients or equipment involved.
     - `"container"`: (Optional) Specifies the container or equipment used.
     - `"action_time"`: Time actively spent by the user doing the action.
     - `"waiting_time"`: Mandatory time the user needs to wait passively after the action is completed, including preheating (e.g., waiting for preheating).
     - `"output"`: Indicates the resulting combination or product after the step, presented as a noun.

6. **Rules and Logic:**
   - Differentiate time with `"action_time"` for active user involvement and `"waiting_time"` for passive waiting periods including but not limited to "perheating over time", "cooking time", "marinating", "cooling".
   - Introduce a `"container"` field to specify equipment or containers.
   - Specify individual actions as sentences like "Marinate Chicken" instead of single words like "Marinate."
   - Include steps for both preparing and combining ingredients.
   - Specify equipment involved in each step.
   - Ensure interconnected steps, where the output of one step becomes the input for the next.
   - Ensure that the `"output"` field represents the resulting combination or product after the step, presented as a noun.
   - If there are no inputs for a step, represent the `"output"` field as an empty array.
   - Try and add a good amount of detail in the recipe steps, tend towards more steps than less.

8. **Customization:**
   - Emphasize flexibility for customization based on specific recipe requirements or preferences. Allow users to adapt the structure to suit their unique cooking processes, acknowledging waiting time, and specific actions for each step.
